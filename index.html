	<h2>Hey there!</h2>
	<p>&emsp;<span>My name is Lucero. I grew up in Arlington Texas and I am fluent in Spanish. Growing up in a traditional Mexican household, it was my first language. When I was in primary school, I attended school in Mexico. Raised by my grandmohter at that time, I learned the value of culture and where we come from. It was the best education I received growing up. In May of 2020, I graduated from Texas Woman's University with a Bachelor's in Business Administration.</span></p>
	<p>&emsp;<span> I love Spanish and culture is extremely important. As a native speaker, hearing people speak Spanish is very rewarding. I believe it's important for us to explore different cultures and languages. It allows you to gain new friends and communicate with other parts of the world. </span></p>
	<p>&emsp;<span> My goal is to teach you Spanish the easiest way possible and guide you. Whether it is basic expressions or your goal is to communicate during a conversation, I can show you the way. </span></p>
	<p>&emsp;<span> We will start from the very beginning... ABC's and go from there. </span></p>
	<br>
	<h2>Let's Connect!</h2>
	<p>&emsp;<span> If you would like to schedule a session, email me or fill out the form below. Tell me a little about yourself, preferred times and your experience with Spanish. I look forward to hearing from you! </span></p>
